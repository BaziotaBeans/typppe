## :construction_worker: How to run

```
You can simply open directly in the browser or download and open in VS Code with the live server extension...
make sure you are using the internet as i am consuming an api I created in github to serve the words
```

## :barber: How we can increase that project
- We turn that in react project
- Make the backend for the user autentication
- Implement the score feature
- Implement the leaderboard, with socket-io for real-time update
- Make dark themes
- And of course, change it any way you can
